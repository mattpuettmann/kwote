# kwote

KWOTE allows users to find and save their favorite quotes, mantras, and words of affirmation.

Users will be able to register accounts by creating profiles using a username, email, and password. Users with accounts will be able to add new quotes to their collections and view the collections of other users.

MVP:
-- Restful API
-- Two-model CRUD app with Users and Quotes
-- Proper communication between models (i.e. deleting a User deletes associated Quotes)
-- Login/Logout with proper error messages
-- Deployable
-- Basic CSS/styling

NICE TO HAVES:
-- Bootstrap/Reactstrap/better than basic styling
-- Fully responsive
