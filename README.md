# kwote

KWOTE allows users to find and save their favorite quotes, mantras, and words of affirmation.

Users will be able to register accounts by creating profiles using a username, email, and password. Users with accounts will be able to add new quotes to their collections and view the collections of other users.

MVP:
1. Restful API
2. Two-model CRUD app with Users and Quotes
3. Proper communication between models (i.e. deleting a User deletes associated Quotes)
4. Login/Logout with proper error messages
5. Deployable
6. Basic CSS/styling

NICE TO HAVES:
1. Bootstrap/Reactstrap/better than basic styling
2. Fully responsive
